# CPSC 441: Computer Networks with Java
### Assignment 1
This assignment aims to achieve several objectives at the same time. The first objective is to learn
the basic structure of a client-server application. The second objective is to learn the general form
and requirements of programming assignments in this course. The third objective is to help you
refresh your Java programming skills and setup your development environment for the rest of
this course. Thus, while simple and straightforward, the expectation is that every student will
try and complete this assignmen

### Assignment 2
The objective of this assignment is to practice network programming and learn about applica-
tion layer protocols. Specifically, you will implement an HTTP client program to download a
web object specified by its URL.

### Assignment 3
The objective of this assignment is to practice server side network programming with TCP.
Specifically, you will implement a multi-threaded web server from scratch to serve web objects
to HTTP clients over the Internet.

### Assignment 4
The objective of this assignment is to practice UDP socket programming and reliable data trans-
fer. Specifically, you will implement a UDP-based program for reliable file transfer based on the
Stop-and-Wait protocol.

### Assignment 5
The objective of this assignment is to practice UDP socket programming and reliable data trans-
fer. Specifically, you will implement a pipelined UDP-based program for reliable file transfer
based on the Go-Back-N protocol, which is more efficient that the Stop and Wait protocol in
